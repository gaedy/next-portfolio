      "title": "Senate up late voting on GOP tax breaks and spending cuts plan that's central to Trump agenda",
      "content": "In a tense session that extended well into the early hours, the U.S. Senate debated a sweeping tax reform and federal budget adjustment bill that has become a cornerstone of the GOP’s renewed economic strategy and a revival of former President Donald Trump’s fiscal vision.\n\nThe bill proposes significant corporate tax reductions—lowering the rate from 21% to 15%—alongside deep cuts to federal programs including environmental protection, public broadcasting, and education grants. Supporters argue the changes will stimulate economic growth, attract more international business investment, and give American corporations a competitive edge in the global marketplace.\n\nHowever, the bill has faced intense scrutiny. Critics from both sides of the aisle have raised alarms about the long-term effects of these cuts, particularly on low-income communities and essential public services. “This plan is a windfall for billionaires and a punch in the gut for working families,” said Sen. Maria Thompson (D-WA). “We cannot build a sustainable economy by sacrificing healthcare, housing, and education.”\n\nDespite the heated rhetoric, the bill narrowly advanced past the committee stage. As of this writing, it awaits a full Senate vote later this week, with several key swing votes still undecided. The outcome could mark a pivotal moment for the direction of U.S. fiscal policy in the post-pandemic recovery era.",
